                        <p>I’ve been wanting to write this for a long time. Getting something off my chest that is both important and necessary. This is written for men, to men and will lay bare the out-of-control situation that exists for us today.</p>
                        <p>As I sit behind the scenes at The Kitchen Coach, I observe the (mostly) women we work with making massive changes and creating a healthier, happier future for their families through whole foods. It is beautiful that these families commit to this change, and incredible some of the transformations that occur.</p>
                        <p>There is a theme though, and one that I know brings a lot of heartache for many women. It’s a theme of resistance, resistance to change.</p>
